## Notes/Extras

Readme file looks awesome. Great job on adding the GIF.

It's not exactly clear when tapping on an item where it actually goes. Might be a bit confusing for first time users.

It's great that you added the Recycler View.

Instead of a  `Thread Runnable` you can use Coroutines, which are a little bit easier to handle in Kotlin.

All of this looks great with a lot of extra stuff we hadn't covered in class. Great job on this!
